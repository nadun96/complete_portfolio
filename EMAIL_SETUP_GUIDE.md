# Email Function Setup Guide

## 🚀 Current Status

The contact form is now set up with email functionality! Currently running in **TEST MODE** which logs to console.

## 📧 Email Sent To: `udarakanadun@gmail.com`

---

## 🧪 Test Mode (Current)

The form is currently using `testEmail()` which:
- ✅ Logs email details to console
- ✅ Shows success notification
- ✅ Doesn't actually send emails (safe for testing)

### To Test:
1. Fill out the contact form
2. Click "Send Message"
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. See the email details logged

4. Get your credentials:
   - Service ID
   - Template ID

   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@3/dist/email.min.js"></script>
   <script>
     (function() {
       emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
